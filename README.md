# BunFight

People from the UK love to argue about what the 'proper' name for a small peice of bread is - some call it a roll, others a barm, in some places it's even called a flower cake. Bunfight hopes to add fuel to the fire of this argument by offering a way for anyone to add their location specific names for that type of bread.

BunFight finds where you are and loads up the most popular name for bread in that area. Disagree? BunFIght gives you the option to add your own name into the database. 

## V1
